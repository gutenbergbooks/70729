<p>No one connected with literature, or who feels a partiality for
reading, on hearing the title of Vortigern and Rowena mentioned, but
has more or less a confused idea respecting this dramatic effort; yet
when inquiry is made, whether any individual has perused the play, it
uniformly occurs, that every one is a total stranger to the production.
It would be difficult to ascertain the reason why the present drama
should have become of such extreme rarity; but, after a continuance
of nine years upon the continent, though incessantly occupied, on my
return, in endeavouring to procure a copy, as well as employing an
eminent theatrical bookseller in the same pursuit, upwards of four
years elapsed ere I obtained copies of my plays of Vortigern and Rowena
and Henry the Second, on which occasion I gladly paid three times the
original publication price for their procurement. Appeals to me have
been so often made, to know where these dramas could be purchased, that
I shall certainly not infringe upon veracity when I state, a limited
edition would long ere this have been disposed of, had copies existed
to supply such repeated demands. Application has at length been made to
me upon the subject of their republication; when, more for the purpose
of seizing an opportunity of saying something in vindication of myself,
than from any desire to give fresh publicity to these dramas, I am
prompted to acquiesce; and they are thus made the vehicle of developing
a variety of sentiments at present influencing my mind, as regard the
subject of my Shaksperian fabrications.</p>

<p>I shall not trouble myself by entering upon an elaborate detail of the
forgery of the papers; any persons feeling at all interested upon that
subject, may find ample food for the gratification of such desire,
in my “Confessions,” one volume octavo, published in 1805. Since the
appearance of the above work, twenty-seven years have elapsed; and my
feelings at the present moment are very differently attuned to what
they were when the “Confessions” were written. It has been justly
remarked, that there exists a time for every thing; and the shafts of
persecution have been so relentlessly levelled against me for upwards
of thirty years, that I begin to conceive sufficient purgation has been
endured, and that every inimical feeling, which now remains, is but the
foul lees of rancour, malice, and uncharitableness. However, as most of
my readers, from the lapse of time, may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</span> unable to appreciate the
drift of my meaning without a clue, I will, in the most succinct manner
possible, make them fully acquainted with the height and sum of my
offending, and then proceed to develop the usage of a certain portion
of the literary world towards me.</p>

<p>My father, (Mr. Samuel Ireland,) a gentleman gifted with the most
open heart and liberal sentiments, chanced, like many others, to be
enamoured of the Fine Arts and Vertu; his assortment of pictures,
prints, and drawings, was universally extolled; his library well
selected; and, above all, his collection of Hogarth’s works (not
even excepting that of his noble competitor for mastery, the late
Earl of Exeter) was not to be surpassed. Among the strongest of his
predilections, my father entertained an unbounded enthusiasm for the
writings of Shakspeare: four days, at least, out of the seven, the
beauties of our divine dramatist became his theme of conversation after
dinner; while in the evening, still further to impress the subject upon
the minds of myself and sisters, certain plays were selected, and a
part allotted to each, in order that we might read aloud, and thereby
acquire a knowledge of the delivery of blank verse articulately, and
with proper emphasis. The comments to which these rehearsals (if I may
be permitted so to call them) gave rise, were of a nature to elicit,
in all its bearings, the enthusiasm entertained by my father for the
bard of Avon—with him Shakspeare was no mortal, but a divinity; and
frequently while expatiating upon this subject, impregnated with all
the fervour of Garrick, with whom he had been on intimate terms,
my father would declare, that to possess a single vestige of the
poet’s hand-writing would be esteemed a gem beyond all price, and far
dearer to him than his whole collection. At these conversations I was
uniformly present, swallowing with avidity the honied poison; when,
by way of completing this infatuation, my father, who had already
produced Picturesque Tours of some of the British rivers, determined on
commencing that of the Avon; and I was selected as the companion of his
journey. Of course, no inquiries were spared, either at Stratford or in
the neighbourhood, respecting the mighty poet. Every legendary tale,
recorded anecdote, or traditionary account, was treasured up; in short,
the name of Shakspeare ushered in the dawn; and a bumper, quaffed to
his immortal memory at night, sealed up our weary eyelids in repose.</p>

<p>We now approach the grand <i>denouement</i>. Having supplied himself
with sketches and notes for his Tour, my father returned to town;
about two years prior to which, I had commenced a course of studies,
to enable me to enter as a practitioner at the Chancery Bar. I will
not take upon myself to determine whether nature ever gifted me with a
dawning of talent for poetry, or whether I possessed a mere facility
at imitation; but the reiterated eulogies rung in my ears respecting
Shakspeare—my father’s enthusiasm—and, above all, the incessant
remark, upon his part, that to possess even a signature of the bard,
would make him the happiest of human beings—irrevocably sealed my
destiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</span></p>

<p>Being in a conveyancer’s office, and environed by old deeds, the silly
idea struck me of investigating numerous bundles of law documents,
in the hope that I might find some instrument signed by Shakspeare;
which labour, of course, proving abortive, I had recourse to a dealer
in old parchments, whose shop I frequented for weeks, under the same
fallacious impression; when, finding all to no purpose, then it was,
(as a German amalgamator of the horrific would assert,) that the demon
seized his opportunity to place temptation in my way. In fine, wearied
by the fruitless toil, in an evil moment, the idea first seized me
of the possibility of producing a spurious imitation of Shakspeare’s
autograph; when, without reflection, having supplied myself with a
tracing of the poet’s signature, I wrote a mortgage deed, imitating
the law hand of James the First, and affixed thereto the sign-manual
of Shakspeare. The instrument in question was shown, accredited in all
directions, and my father rendered happy; when, without a thought of
any thing further, I conceived myself amply recompensed in having been
the instrument of producing so much felicity.</p>

<p>Let me now inquire of the reader whether he traces, to the above
period, any great mental delinquency in my proceedings? Was I biassed
by selfish motives, or could I be charged with any thing but the
thoughtless impulse of a head-strong youth, under seventeen years of
age, whose only aim was to afford pleasure to a parent? Falsehood,
though trivial, is, however, the first step to crime; and although
mine was not of a very heinous nature, the sequel will develop what
important and injurious consequences may result from a first departure
from veracity.</p>

<p>For some days this mortgage deed, purporting to be between Shakspeare,
and one Michael Fraser and Elizabeth his wife, was inspected by crowds
of antiquaries, and Shaksperian enthusiasts; when, on a sudden, the
question was started, concerning where the deed had been found. I
was, of course, appealed to; and never having once dreamed of such
a question, it was on that occasion the first serious difficulty
presented itself to my imagination. <i>Fallacia alia aliam trudit.</i>
The tale resorted to was as simple as possible, namely: That I had
formed an acquaintance with a gentleman of ancient family, possessed
of a mass of deeds and papers relating to his ancestors, who, finding
me very partial to the examination of old documents, had permitted me
to inspect them; that shortly after commencing my search, the mortgage
deed in question had fallen into my hands, which had been presented
to me by the proprietor. I added, that the personage alluded to, well
aware the name of Shakspeare must create a considerable sensation,
and being a very retiring and diffident man, had bound me, by a
solemn engagement, never to divulge his name. Such was the manner
in which I accounted for becoming possessed of the deed, sincerely
trusting that the matter would thenceforward remain buried in eternal
oblivion. Your German writer of the marvellous would exclaim: “No,
no! it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span> was then too late: you had fallen into the demon’s snare—was
spell-bound—within the vortex of his machinations, and incapable of
extricating yourself from the impending fate that awaited you:” be this
as it may, I was not permitted to continue passive. The late Honourable
Mr. Byng, afterwards Lord Torrington; Sir Frederick Eden, Bart.; and
a long string of persons, whose names it would be superfluous to
annex, gave it as their decided opinions, <i>that wheresover I had
found the deed, there, no doubt, the mass of papers existed, which
had been so long and vainly sought after by the numerous commentators
upon Shakspeare</i>. These assertions, incessantly dinned into my
father’s ears, were retailed to me with increased vehemence. I was
sometimes supplicated; at others, commanded to resume my search among
my supposed friend’s papers; and not unfrequently taunted, as being
an absolute idiot, for suffering such a brilliant opportunity to
escape me. Thus circumstanced, I knew not how to act; and cursed the
first precipitate measure I had adopted: while, at every meal, when
I presented myself, the same alarum was rung in my ears, so that no
alternative remained but to attempt something further, or be regarded
in the light of a downright fool, not only by my father, but by the
numerous personages who had inspected and placed confidence in the
mortgage deed. My evil genius predominated: I penned a few letters,
and “The Profession of Faith,” all of which passed muster; although,
in many instances, <i>the documents produced as two hundred years old,
had not been fabricated many hours previous to their production</i>.
For a detailed account of all these forgeries, I refer the reader to
my “Confessions,” before adverted to; having merely to add, that I
ultimately announced the existence of a drama, being guided in this,
as in former instances, by the same thoughtless impetuosity: for it
will scarcely be credited, that, on hazarding such a bold statement,
I literally had never essayed my pen at poetical composition, and had
not penned one line of the play which I purposed producing, being no
other than the present drama of Vortigern and Rowena. Prior to the
completion of this piece, the fame of my various fabrications had
resounded from one extremity of the kingdom to the other; and on the
completion of the undertaking, strenuous applications were made by the
late Mr. Harris, of Covent Garden Theatre, who, in order to possess
the play, forwarded a <i>carte blanche</i> (by Mr. Wallace, father of
the then highly-esteemed actress of that name) to Mr. Samuel Ireland,
with which, had my father acquiesced, as that theatre was favoured by
the King and the Court, there would have been great probability of its
success: however, a long intimacy with the Sheridan and Linley families
turned the scale in favour of Drury Lane, where it was subsequently
represented. Prior to this period, however, the validity of the papers
had begun to be questioned, the late Mr. Malone standing forth as
generalissimo of the non-believers. Some pamphlets, <i>pro and con</i>,
had also issued from the press; while the newspapers incessantly teemed
with paragraphs, written on the spur of the moment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span> dictated
from the particular sentiments entertained as to the papers by their
authors. Malone, in the interim, having collected his mass of documents
intended to prove the whole a forgery, committed them to the press,
under a hope that he should be able to publish his volumes before
the representation of Vortigern: the bulkiness of his production,
however, having defeated that object, he, on the day the piece was to
be performed, issued a notice, to the effect that he had a work on the
eve of publication, which would infallibly prove the manuscripts in Mr.
Ireland’s possession mere fabrications, and warning the people not to
be imposed upon by the play advertised for that night’s representation,
as being from the pen of Shakspeare. My father having procured a copy
of this notice, though late in the day, instantly forwarded to the
press the following hand-bill, and distributed a vast quantity among
the assembled multitudes then choaking up every avenue to Drury Lane
Theatre:—</p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">Vortigern.</span>
</p>

<p>“A <i>malevolent</i> and <i>impotent</i> attack on the Shakspeare
MSS. having appeared, on the <i>eve</i> of representation of the play
of <i>Vortigern</i>, evidently intended to injure the interest of
the proprietor of the MSS., Mr. Ireland feels it impossible, within
the short space of time that intervenes between the publishing and
the representation, to produce an answer to the most illiberal and
unfounded assertions in Mr. Malone’s “Inquiry”; he is, therefore,
induced to request, that the play of <i>Vortigern</i> may be heard
with that <i>candour</i> that has ever distinguished a <i>British
audience</i>.</p>

<p class="center">
“<i>The Play is now at the Press, and will, in a very few days, be laid</i>
<i>before the public.</i>”
</p>

<p>If, however, an active enemy was found in the person of Mr. Malone,
another equally implacable, and enabled to strike a more deadly
blow, as regarded the success of my play, appeared in the person of
Mr. Kemble, then acting manager of Drury Lane Theatre; who, in that
capacity, was of course empowered to direct his whole influence against
the piece, of which he did not fail to take advantage, as will appear
from my father’s preface subjoined, which accompanied the original
edition of Vortigern. Indeed, so notorious was Mr. Kemble’s conduct, in
opposition to the interests of the theatre, that, after the termination
of the play, Mr. Sheridan, in the green-room, very unceremoniously gave
Mr. Kemble to understand, “that <i>he had nothing to do with his (Mr.
Kemble’s) private opinions respecting the validity or spuriousness of
the manuscripts; that he appeared there as a servant of the theatre,
whose bounden duty it should have been to exert himself for the
purpose of insuring success, instead of invidiously toiling to damn a
production, which might have brought thousands to the treasury of that
establishment</i>.” To this address, delivered in my presence, Mr.
Kemble uttered not one word in reply.</p>

<p>Six-and-thirty years have now transpired since the drama of Vortigern
and Rowena was performed, (on Saturday, the <i>second</i> day of
April, 1796). If may be worthy of remark, that the strenuous efforts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span>
of the acting manager, Mr. J. P. Kemble, were not wanting to procure
its representation on the <i>Friday night preceding</i>, in order to
pass upon the audience the compliment of <i>Fools All!</i> This was,
however, overruled, by the decided opposition of my father; although he
found it necessary to interpose the authority of Mr. Sheridan for that
purpose. Finding himself thus foiled, in the grand attempt at producing
Vortigern on <i>April Fool night</i>, that the after-piece might carry
a sting in its tail, Mr. Kemble announced <i>My Grandmother</i> for the
farce, intending that all the bearings of that production should be
applied by the audience to the subject of the Shaksperian papers. This
was not all: leagued with Malone, and the sworn opponents, in defiance
of the duty he owed to the theatre, Mr. Kemble had recourse to every
expedient prior to, as well as on the night of, representation, in
order to crush the play; for which purpose he particularly selected the
following line:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And when this solemn mockery is o’er,”</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that having been the preconcerted signal when the opponents of the
papers were to manifest their disapprobation. Having, in the course of
his part, arrived at the anxiously expected line, he delivered it in an
exceedingly pointed manner; when, <i>of course</i>, a deafening clamour
reigned throughout one of the most crowded houses ever recollected in
theatrical history, which lasted for several minutes. Upon a hearing
being at length obtained, instead of taking up the following line of
the speech in rotation, Mr. Kemble reiterated the above line with an
expression the most pointedly sarcastic and acrimonious it is possible
to conceive. The result was, from that moment so deafening became the
uproar produced by conflicting applause and disapproval, that not one
syllable more of the play was rendered intelligible. The speech, of
which the above line forms a part, will be found towards the close of
the second scene of act the fifth, being the last scene but one of
the drama; prior to which, no hostility had been manifested. Indeed,
so decided was the applause, that many of the performers appeared
confident of the success of the play; among whom, in particular, was
the late inimitable Mrs. Jordan, personating the character of Flavia
in my drama, with whom I remained in close conversation during a
considerable portion of the performance, that lady uniformly persisting
in offering her congratulations on the success that awaited the drama,
of which “<i>I had been the fortunate discoverer</i>.”—[How little did
I then imagine, that the lapse of a few short years would behold me
following that neglected, but unmatched Thalia of the British stage, to
her last long home in the cemetery of St. Cloud; where her remains now
moulder, with scarcely a memento to designate the spot that enshrouds
them.]</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the pointed hostility manifested by Mr. Kemble, in
every stage of this business, it would be the height of injustice not
to mention the strenuous exertions, for the success of the piece,
manifested by Messrs. Bensley, Barrymore, Caulfield, and King, with
Mesdames Powel and Jordan. Those, however, who have any recollection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span>
of such walking automatons as Benson and Phillimore being made to
figure in my tragedy, can form a shrewd surmise of what the acting
manager intended should prove the result of the performance. Added
to this, the late Mr. Dignum was purposely placed by Mr. Kemble in a
subordinate part, wherein, speaking of the sounding of trumpets, he
had to exclaim, “<i>Let them bellow on!</i>” which words were uttered
with such a nasal and tin-kettle twang, that no muscles, save those of
adamant, could have resisted the powerful incentive to laughter.</p>

<p>Having brought the subject of the representation of Vortigern to
a close, I shall now enter upon that portion of my preface which
comes closest to my own feelings; and if, in the progress of my
remarks, I may at times appear somewhat instigated by a sentiment of
vindictiveness, let me entreat the reader to commune with himself,
and to inquire what would be the state of his mind, after suffering
thirty-six years incessant persecution and obloquy, for the commission
of an act intended only to please a parent, and which, in reality, has
injured no one but its author, and that being he so fondly strove to
gratify.</p>

<p>Some time after the appearance of Malone’s long expected
“Investigation,” Mr. Chalmers published, first his “Apology for
the Believers,” and then a “Supplemental Apology”; wherein, though
advocating the untenable side of the question, he displayed a far
greater depth of antiquarian research, and scholastic reasoning, than
his opponent; in short, there is scarcely one position laid down by
Malone, which is not most satisfactorily refuted by Chalmers. At the
commencement of this warfare, as to whether the manuscripts were
genuine or not, the state of my poor father’s mind was pitiable in the
extreme; he as firmly crediting the originality of the papers, as I was
aware of their fabrication.</p>

<p>For myself I can conscientiously assert, that this warfare affected me
no further, than as creating uneasiness in the mind of my suffering
parent: but when insinuations began to be directed against <i>his</i>
character, which were ultimately converted into the following <i>bonâ
fide</i> assertions—“That the youthful period of my life precluding
all possibility of the papers being mine, the whole must of necessity
have been fabricated by my father, who had made me the vehicle of
introducing them to the public”—I must candidly confess the equanimity
of my temper no longer remained unruffled. Never was a creature more
basely calumniated, or subjected to more unmerited contumely. It is not
because I am speaking of a parent, that I make this declaration; had
Mr. Ireland been a mere acquaintance, it would be no more than my duty
thus to exonerate, and once more proclaim aloud to the world his entire
innocence. Not only was he a total stranger to every proceeding of
mine, as regarded the composition of the papers; but, from principle,
totally incapable of having even connived, much less have been himself
the fabricator. There existed, in my father’s character, a marked
tenacity respecting adherence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span> truth; and it was the thorough
knowledge of his rigid principles on that head that long deterred me
from making an ample confession of the fact, so much did I apprehend
from the effects of his indignation, if made acquainted with the real
nature of the whole transaction.</p>

<p>I had nearly forgotten to remark, that among other suppositions
hazarded on the subject of concocting the forgery, some persons have
been led to imagine, and still conceive, that the late George Steevens
was my secret abettor, and gave me his assistance. Now, so remote was
this from being the fact, that I never saw the commentator in question
but once, and that after my producing the papers: this was in the shop
of the late Mr. Richardson, printseller, then residing at the corner of
Villiers Street, Strand.</p>

<p>Invariably, when descanting with persons on the subject of the papers,
they have applauded the cheat, expressed a wish of having been capable
of deceiving the world in a similar manner; and they have then
uniformly concluded by upbraiding me for having avowed the fact. Never,
indeed, should the world have been gratified by extorting from my lips
one syllable approximating to a confession, had I not been urged by
the imperious motives of rescuing my father’s character from unmerited
obloquy; then I did come forward with the truth, having first abandoned
the paternal roof, and relinquished a profession for which I was
studying; and, with the wide world before me, and a host of the most
implacable enemies at my back, ere my twentieth year, I entered upon
the eventful pilgrimage of life, without a guide to direct my steps,
or any means of existence, save those which might result from my own
industry and perseverance.</p>

<p>Some time after this avowal, I forwarded two very humble apologetic
letters to Mr. George Chalmers, who never deigned to reply; these were
followed by various others, on the publication of my “Confessions”
in 1805, addressed to the leading personages who had advocated the
validity of the MSS.</p>

<p>All my efforts, however, proved of no avail; the same animosity
was manifested towards me, by a phalanx styling themselves the
rigid censors of literature, and the guardians of Shakspeare’s
fame; consisting of such persons, for instance, as <i>Malone</i>,
<i>Kemble</i>, <i>Dr. Parr</i>, <i>Boaden</i>, <i>Waldron</i>, with
a string of <i>etceteras</i>, too tedious for enumeration. Would it
be credited, that such men have proceeded to the ridiculous length of
ranking my offence on a par with the forgery of a bank-bill; and, I am
thoroughly convinced, would have felt infinite delight in witnessing
my exit as a delinquent at the Old Bailey. If an untruth in literary
matters were so heinous an offence, whence comes it that the late Sir
Horace Walpole, afterwards Lord Orford, escaped the lash of reproof,
for palming off his “Castle of Otranto” as the translation from an
old Italian MS.? and why were not a long list of others, guilty of
similar literary misdemeanours, dragged forth to public execration?
No! the whole, except in the instance of poor Chatterton, to whose
memory the world has since done justice, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span> reserved for my devoted
head; every burthen was accumulated on my shoulders: this I have
endured with stoicism, until I conceive my penance fully achieved;
and when I witness the splendid example of Sir Walter Scott, whose
repeated denials, even to Majesty itself, of the authorship of the so
called Waverly Novels, have rather added to than detracted from his
well-earned literary reputation, I trust that so youthful an infraction
of the great principle of truth should not be too bitterly remembered,
and that I may now stand acquitted before the grand ordeal of society.</p>

<p>Having nothing more to add on the general subject of the Shaksperian
papers, I shall wind up this prefatory address by a few observations on
the conduct of those, who, arrogating to themselves a dictatorship in
regard to every thing connected with the literature of Shakspeare, have
been my unceasing persecutors.</p>

<p>Among these may be mentioned, the deceased Dr. Parr, of Greek
celebrity, whose death, instead of accumulating a fresh odor of
sanctity around his fame, has tended to open men’s eyes, who now begin
to find out, that the Doctor was not exactly that mighty phenomenon
for which he had enjoyed the reputation, while living. A catalogue of
this learned Theban’s books has been published, under the title of
“<i>Bibliotheca Parriana</i>,” wherein the MS. opinions of the Doctor,
as inserted in a multiplicity of works, are given to the public.</p>

<p>At p. 522 appears the following note from this <i>scholastic, erudite,
and Christian divine</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ireland’s (Samuel)” <i>great and impudent forgery,
called</i>, “Miscellaneous Papers and Legal
Instruments, under the Hand and Seal of William
Shakespeare.” Folio, 1796.</p>
</div>

<p>“I am almost ashamed to insert this worthless and infamously trickish
book. It is said to include the tragedy of King Lear, and a fragment
of Hamlet. Ireland told a <span class="allsmcap">LIE</span>, when he imputed to <i>me</i>
the words which <i>Joseph Warton</i> used, the very morning I called
on Ireland, and was inclined to admit the possibility of genuineness
in his papers. In my subsequent conversation, I told him my change of
opinion. But I thought it not worth while to dispute in print with a
detected impostor.</p>

<p class="right">
“S. P.”
</p>

<p>Here we have a sample of clerical politeness, mixed up with heartfelt
ranklings, because it was impossible for the divine to deny that he
had been <i>a staunch believer in the MSS. and the dupe of a boy of
seventeen</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that it was <i>Dr. Warton</i>, instead of himself, as stated
in error in my “Confessions,” who passed a most pompous eulogy on my
Shakspeare’s Profession of Faith: but it so happens that I was present
when <i>Drs. Parr and Warton</i> together inspected the papers; and it
was on that memorable occasion that the latter, after the documents
had been <i>twice read</i> by both of them, made use of the following
words, in which Dr. Parr not only concurred, but himself pronounced
panegyrics equally forcible: “<i>Sir, we have many fine things in
our church service, and our Litany abounds in beauties; but here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
sir, here is a man who has distanced us all.</i>” As to a subsequent
interview, stated to have taken place with my father, it is a gross
falsehood; and was merely incorporated in the above note to palliate,
as much as possible, the Doctor’s want of accuracy, in having accorded
the sanction of his name to my MSS. These, indeed, were pitiable
subterfuges for a churchman to descend to, and altogether unbecoming a
person of the Doctor’s erudition, and high standing in society.</p>

<p>So much for the dead:—now for a living opponent. On the present
occasion I have the honor to introduce to the reader, James Boaden,
Esq. than whom a more fitting sample could not be ushered upon the
<i>tapis</i>, to bring up the burthen of my tale with <i>eclat</i>; and
prove, in their fullest extent, the assertions so frequently repeated,
of the implacable hatred, and unremitting vindictiveness, uniformly
practised in regard to me.</p>

<p>This person was one of the earliest and most frequent visitors at the
house of my father, in Norfolk Street, after my production of the MSS.
had excited a considerable sensation in the world. He was, at that
period, editor of the “Oracle” newspaper, and in such capacity welcomed
by my father, with all that ingenuousness for which he rendered
himself conspicuous. The papers were laid before Mr. Boaden, <i>who
not only verbally, but by letter to my father, and in paragraphs out
of number, inserted in his diurnal, expressed a thorough conviction of
their genuine stamp, not only from external but internal evidence</i>:
neither did the MSS. alone produce conviction; but, to use his own
words, they excited “<i>a tremor of the purest delight</i>”; such
persuasion of their excellence being retained for months, “<i>making
all scepticism ridiculous</i>.” Yet this man of <i>correct judgment</i>
ultimately discovers that the whole was an <i>error in judgment</i>,
which he excuses in his letter to George Steevens, with this very terse
remark: that <i>“credulity is no disgrace,” and “strong enthusiasm
eager to believe.”</i> Now, I should like to ask any man, boasting the
smallest pretensions to common sense, whether, if one of Mr. Boaden’s
Poems, or one of the Psalms, as translated by Sternhold and Hopkins,
was produced in the hand-writing of the period of Elizabeth, or printed
by Didot, in his most superlative style, on wire wove, &amp;c.; I should
like, I say, to inquire, whether the apparent antiquity on the one
hand, or the modern blazonry displayed on the other, could add one
iota to the merits of the composition? and whether, in case any man,
standing forward as a literary character, was to attach the epithet
of sublime to the doggerel of Boaden or Sternhold, he would not be
regarded as a consummate blockhead for his pains.</p>

<p>In p. 5 of a pamphlet, entitled <i>A Comparative Review of the Opinions
of Mr. Boaden, in the Years 1795 and 1796</i>, we find as follows, in
reference to the subject of my papers:—</p>

<p>“Mr. Boaden is very liberal in acknowledging in his pamphlet, (what
indeed he could not deny, because it would have remained recorded
against him in his newspapers,) that he was, at first, strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
affected in favor of the MSS.; neither does he deny that he admitted
their <i>style, diction, and poetical spirit</i>; but he leaves us to
discover by what new light, by what cogency of argument, that which was
once distinguished for “<i>the utmost delicacy of passion and poetical
spirit</i>,” became <i>afterwards</i> “worthy of no other notice than
that of being <i>metrically smooth</i>”; <i>and</i>, that which was
“<i>rationally pious and grandly expressed</i>,” became “<i>execrable
jargon</i>,” the “<i>puerile quaintness and idiomatic poverty of a
methodist rhapsody</i>.” However, to enter into a detail respecting
the numerous <i>tergiversations of this writer</i> would extend my
Preface beyond all reasonable bounds; I, therefore, refer the reader
to my “Confessions,” p. 176, &amp;c. for a <i>further</i> elucidation of
the <i>consistency</i> displayed by J. Boaden, Esq. during his literary
interference at the period in question.”</p>

<p>I shall now suffer some six and twenty years to roll on, and again
introduce the above personage to my reader’s notice, under the
following circumstances. Between seven and eight years back, I
was engaged in preparing a MS. for Mr. Triphook, then residing in
Bond-street; at which period, it so occurred, that James Boaden,
<i>Esq.</i> was occupied in forwarding through the press, his
“Inquiry into the Authenticity of the various Pictures and Prints
of Shakspeare,” of which work Mr. Triphook was also the publisher.
During my frequent attendances in Bond-street, it is not surprising
that I should encounter Mr. Boaden with feelings, heaven knows! widely
different from those whereby that gentleman was actuated. Conceiving,
however, in the frankness of my heart, that upwards of a quarter of a
century must have cancelled all recollections of the past, and allayed
every latent animosity, I spoke to Mr. Boaden without indulging a
rancorous thought, notwithstanding the provocations received at his
hands, whensoever he had found an opportunity of abusing me. After
several casual meetings of this description in Mr. Triphook’s shop,
fully aware of the work whereon Mr. Boaden was then occupied, I offered
to furnish, through Mr. Triphook, an account of a variety of spurious
oil paintings and miniatures of Shakspeare, that have been sent into
the world; which MS. I remitted to Mr. Triphook, who handed the same
to Mr. Boaden. The work of the latter gentleman, at length, appeared;
but he had scrupulously avoided making use of my MS. thus gratuitously
tendered; and for this plain reason: it would have debarred him from
the superlative gratification of venting anew his malice against
me; which he has done in different parts of the said work, but more
particularly in the opening Preface, at the first and second pages of
which appears as follows:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A period</span> <i>of my life, of something more than forty years,
has been devoted to the study of Shakspeare’s works; and, on some
outrageous liberties which, in the year 1796, were taken with his name,
I had the honour to address a letter to the late George Steevens, Esq.,
which brought before the public the first detector of an impudent and
very unskilful forgery. Upon that occasion, the great Commentator
expressed a very agreeable opinion of my little work, by saying with
his accustomed point: “Sir, you have very fairly gibbeted the culprit,
and Mr. Malone will take him down and dissect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span> him</i>;”—<span class="allsmcap">A
TASK</span> (adds Mr. Boaden) <span class="allsmcap">PERFORMED BY HIM WITH AN ANATOMICAL
MINUTENESS, WHICH LEFT NOT THE SMALLEST NERVE OF THAT BODY OF FRAUD
UNEXPOSED TO THE PUBLIC EYE</span>.”</p>

<p>Such was the charitable recompense, for a kindness tendered to a
man, who, like myself, I conceived incapable of hoarding up malice
and hatred for such a series of years; but, alas! beings of this
description, I have had, like blood-hounds at my heels, goading me
to the very brink of destruction. In regard to Mr. Boaden’s work, on
the subject of the genuine portraits of our Bard, I think I may with
veracity state, that had the writer inserted my MS. respecting the
forged resemblances of the poet, that portion of the work would have
proved by far the most entertaining part of his production, which has
been refuted, in many parts, by Mr. Wyville; who, without possessing
any of the boasted Greek and Latin of Mr. Boaden, or indeed a proper
knowledge of English grammar, has proved the former writer altogether
incompetent to discuss the comparative merits of oil paintings or
engravings. The engravings illustrative of Mr. Boaden’s book, furnished
by Mr. Triphook, constitute the only worth of that volume, which,
from the publishing price, has fallen two-thirds in value, being now
bought for the sake of the portraits it contains. Another of this
book-maker’s lucubrations, is the life of his divinity the late J.
P. Kemble, two volumes 8vo.; who, if we were to take the writer’s
<i>ipse dixit</i>, was faultless as a man, and in the histrionic walk,
something super-human. Now we happen to know somewhat concerning
John Philip, as well as Mr. Boaden; and had it fallen to our lot to
chronicle his sayings and doings, we should have paid a little more
attention to that very necessary ingredient in biographical writing,
called <i>veracity</i>; that is to say, we should have incorporated the
sombre and shadowy tints, in colouring the picture, and should not have
pourtrayed John Philip, like a Chinese limner—<i>all whiteness</i>. We
have known of <i>such</i> things, as theatrical Bacchanalian orgies,
held in taverns under the Piazzas, when the bottle has circulated, until</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The grey-eyed morn peep’d o’er the eastern sky”:</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">at which carousals, great John Philip has sallied forth,
vaulted the standings near the <i>Finish</i>, (where the men and women
porters were accustomed to pitch their loads,) and from such exalted
station, mine hero, has harangued the matinal multitude of the garden,
with pithy speeches, to their great edification. We have equally heard
of <i>Tarquin strides</i> behind the scenes, which gave rise to the
dreadful:—“<span class="smcap">Whereas, I, John Philip</span>,” &amp;c.—all facts of such
a tendency however, are expunged from the <i>faithful biography</i>
of Mr. Boaden: who resolutely determined that the world should have
enough of the family, has since eked out another pair of ponderous
tomes, <i>purporting</i> to be the life of Mrs. Siddons; wherein we
will venture to assert, there are topics introduced, having no more
reference to that lady, than there exists an affinity between Mr.
Boaden and the milk of human charity. One word more concerning this
personage, and we close our labour. Previous to the publication of his
volume, before adverted to, respecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span> the portraits of Shakspeare,
and daring my casual intercourse with Mr. Boaden at Mr. Triphook’s,
we one day walked out together, and arrived opposite the end of
Buckingham-street, in the Adelphi. The subject of our conversation
had been Shakspeare and my fabrications, when, on a sudden, pausing,
my pompous companion, having summoned up a look of the mightiest
import, thus addressed me:—“<i>You must be aware, sir, of the enormous
crime you committed against the divinity of Shakspeare. Why, the
act, sir, was nothing short of sacrilege; it was precisely the same
thing as taking the holy chalice from the altar, and * * * * * * *
therein!!!!</i>”</p>

<p>There is a point in comparison, which renders bathos mere foolery.
Comment is unnecessary; but there was something so preposterously
ridiculous in the idea of assimilating my attempt to imitate
Shakspeare, and the violation of the sacred mysteries of the altar,
that had I raised my eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Boaden, I could
not have repressed the burst of laughter, which then struggled for vent.</p>

<p>To hear an aged, walking mass of mortality, utter such a sample of
mingled pedantry and folly, has left such an indelible impression upon
my mind, that I never pass the spot in question, without a sentiment
of pity, on recalling the ravings of a self-created expounder of
Shakspeare, dwindled into second childhood.</p>

<p>I shall now close this Preface, which has already exceeded its limits,
with two simple comments: If my productions were such miserable trash,
as Mr. Boaden and his coadjutors asserted, (and, heaven knows! I have
never claimed any great merit for their production,) what becomes of
the intellects of those who stamped them, in many respects, worthy
the Bard of Avon? And supposing the latter assertion <i>could</i> be,
in the very <i>smallest</i> degree, correct, to what can be ascribed
the malignity with which I have been pursued, but to an ignoble and
dastardly sentiment of envy, nurtured in the bosoms of those, who were
the dupes of a stripling in years, and a total novice in the paths of
literature?</p>

<p>I cannot wind up the present Address, without testifying the heartfelt
gratitude I feel, in avowing, that the candour of the present
generation, so far from hunting me down, on account of this error of
my youth, is willing to allow every credit that may be attachable to
me, on the score of talent, however mediocre; at the same time, I claim
from the public fiat, an acquittal of the only charge that could have
been urged against me,—namely, a preorganized plan of fraud, under a
base and sordid hope of pecuniary profit, instead of that most enviable
of all rewards, which I had fallaciously hoped to ensure—the permanent
gratification of beholding a father happy.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITION OF 1799, BY MR. SAMUEL IRELAND.</p>


<p>It is now near three years since the Play, which the following
sheets present to the public, was represented at the Theatre Royal,
Drury Lane. The fate which it underwent, and the decision of the
audience, are well known. Notwithstanding that decision, the Editor
has, at length, agreeably to his promise made at the time of that
representation, again laid it before the public; which, if it exposes
it to the test of a more accurate criticism, will give it the
opportunity of a more unbiassed and temperate examination.</p>

<p>They who are at all conversant with dramatic concerns, must know
that the opinion of large assemblies, promiscuously composed of all
orders and classes, must depend on a variety of circumstances, local,
temporary, and accidental.</p>

<p>Where no stronger or worse motives interfere, fashion and caprice
too often give the direction; but spleen and interest are made
more powerful agents; and by their industry and activity, even the
master-puppet, be he in sock or buskin, may be gained, and the public
may be too easily and unwarily led by premature and precipitate
conclusions.</p>

<p>No man who recollects what was said and written in the public prints
concerning this piece, on the eve of its representation, and the
ludicrous manner in which the principal character was sustained, can
deny, that the Editor has a right to complain of the most illiberal and
injurious treatment.</p>

<p>Every undue stratagem, and every mean and petty artifice, was resorted
to within doors and without, to prejudice the public mind; and one
more deeply interested than had then, or has yet appeared, though a
professed trader on the subject of Shakspeare, on the day before the
representation, under the title of “An Enquiry into the Authenticity of
certain miscellaneous Papers, &amp;c. &amp;c.” with this view, and the further
expectation of helping off a few copies, sent into the world a volume
long before promised, and long since forgotten.</p>

<p>This mass of dulness and self-conceit, consisting of about 430 pages,
established nothing; and was built on principles (if it is not an abuse
to apply to such trash, a term so respectable) that could not possibly
establish any thing. In every one of the instances which, with such a
weak and overweening confidence, he so very idly brought forward, he
has been exposed; and in some of them has been himself the author and
detector of his own childishness, incapacity and ignorance.</p>

<p>Neither the index-lore, or the alphabetical, lexicographical labours of
this sagacious discoverer, or his congenial followers or associates,
nor any declaration since made from a quarter once domestic to the
Editor, through which something like genuine information might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span>
naturally have been expected, can induce him to believe that great part
of the mass of papers in his possession are the fabrication of any
individual, or set of men of the present day.</p>

<p>A fruitless expectation, that time, the discoverer of truth, might
ere this have withdrawn that veil of mystery which yet involves this
transaction, has alone given occasion to delay this publication. The
Editor had been happy to have been able to have penetrated it; and to
have assigned to its proper owner each fragment and each whole.</p>

<p>As to the merits or demerits of the Play now before the public, the
Editor does not in the smallest degree consider himself responsible any
where, or in any way. He sold the piece with “all its imperfections
on its head,” after various cool and deliberate readings, and stated
candidly all he had been told relative to it; all that, which, from
various circumstances, he had at that time no reason to doubt or
discredit.</p>

<p>After the Play was contracted for, some alterations were deemed
necessary to fit it for representation. It was much too long, and
consequently many passages were expunged; and, in one historical fact,
(thought too gross for the public ear, <i>viz.</i> the incestuous
passion of the king towards his daughter,) it underwent some further
alterations; but, excepting these particulars, it stands nearly as in
the original.</p>

<p>In this state it was delivered to the theatre, with a request, or
rather <i>entreaty</i>, that all further alteration, deemed necessary,
should be made by the acting manager, or any other person competent to
the business: to this request he received the following official answer
from Mr. Kemble:—“That the play would be acted faithfully from the
copy sent to the theatre”; and it was accordingly acted, literally,
from the manuscript delivered to the house. This conduct was, as the
Editor believes, unprecedented in the management of a theatre; and must
warrant him in concluding, that, in the judgment of the acting manager,
the play wanted no aid or alteration.</p>

<p>Be these matters as they may, this Piece is laid before the public,
with such interpolations by the Editor, as he presumes it was the duty
of the acting manager to have made previous to its representation.</p>

<p>The lines printed within the inverted commas were not in the playhouse
copy, and consequently were not spoken.</p>

<p>The Editor feels, and here begs leave to acknowledge, his obligations
to his friend, William Linley, Esq., for his skill in composing the
three songs in this Piece, in which he is universally allowed to have
shown much taste and judgment; he likewise professes himself much
indebted to Mrs. Jordan and Mrs. Powell, for their very spirited
exertions and excellent acting on this occasion; and could he, with
truth or justice, make the smallest acknowledgment to Mr. Kemble, and
his fellow tragedian, Mr. Phillimore, he has little doubt but that,
whoever may have been the author of the piece, it might still have been
received, and might have promoted the interests of the theatre.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">The cause, with learn’d investigation fraught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Behold, at length, to this tribunal brought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No fraud your penetrating eyes can cheat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">None here can Shakspeare’s writing counterfeit.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As well the taper’s base, unlustrous ray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Might strive to emulate the orb of day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As modern bards, whom venal hopes inspire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Can catch one spark of his celestial fire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If in our scenes your eyes delighted find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Marks that denote the mighty master’s mind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If at his words, the tears of pity flow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your breasts with horror thrill, with rapture glow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If on your harrow’d souls impress’d you feel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The stamp of nature’s uncontested seal;—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Demand no other proof, nor idly pore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er mouldy manuscripts of ancient lore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To see if every tawny line display</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The genuine ink of fam’d Eliza’s day:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor strive with curious industry to know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How poets spelt two centuries ago.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But if these proofs should fail; if in the strain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You seek the drama’s awful sire in vain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet in our ancient legend should you trace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Truth’s genuine features, tho’ of humbler grace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Condemn not rashly. O’er the forest glade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tho’ the oak spread no patriarchal shade,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet may a shrub of no unlovely green</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With vivid foliage deck the sylvan scene;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some tuneful notes the vocal woodlands fill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And sooth the ear, tho’ Philomel be still.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then each extraneous matter laid aside,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By its own merit be our drama tried.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forget the prejudice of rigid art,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To read the code of nature in the heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Consult her laws, from partial favour free,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And give as they decide, your just decree.</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No common cause your verdict now demands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before the court immortal Shakspeare stands;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That mighty master of the human soul,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who rules the passions, and with strong control</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thro’ every turning of the changeful heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Directs his course sublime, and leads his powerful art.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When on his birth propitious nature smil’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hung transported o’er her favourite child;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While on his head her choicest gifts she shower’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And o’er his mind her inspiration pour’d:—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Proceed,” she cried, “the high decree fulfil!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis thine to rule, with magic sway, the will;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“On fancy’s wing to stretch o’er boundless space,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“And all creation’s varied works to trace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis thine each flitting phantom to pursue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Each hidden power of verse to bring to view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“To shed o’er British taste celestial day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“And reign o’er Genius with unrivall’d sway.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Such was the high behest—the sacred choice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long has been sanction’d by our candid voice:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The favour’d relics of your Shakspeare’s hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unrivall’d, and inimitable, stand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">If hope of fame some modern bards has led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To try the path where Shakspeare wont to tread;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, with presumptuous wing, they dar’d aspire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To catch some portion of his sacred fire,—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your critic pow’rs the vain attempt repell’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flimsy vapour, by your breath dispell’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Expos’d the trembling culprit to your sight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While Shakspeare’s radiance shone with doubled light.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From deep oblivion snatch’d, this play appears:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It claims respect, since Shakspeare’s name it bears;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That name, the source of wonder and delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To a fair hearing has at least a right.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We ask no more—with you the judgment lies;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No forgeries escape your piercing eyes!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unbiass’d, then, pronounce your dread decree,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alike from prejudice and favour free.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If, the fierce ordeal pass’d, you chance to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rich sterling ore, tho’ rude and unrefin’d,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stamp it your own; assert your poet’s fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And add, fresh wreaths to Shakspeare’s honour’d name.</div>

<p><i>Fool.</i> Good Fool, say’st thou! Marry, these are sweet words, that
do not often fall to our lot; but let me tell you, good master, fools
have excellent wits, and those that ha’ none will gladly go flatter,
lest the fool’s folly should make them still more foolish.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i> But, prithee, tell us what is thine affair?</p>

<p><i>Fool.</i> Oh! my affair is weighty indeed, being burthened with the
speech o’ royalty.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i> And wherefore so!</p>

<p><i>Fool.</i> I prithee, stay thy patience but awhile, and I will tell
thee: thou dost expect nought from the Fool but folly; but from a king
thou wouldst a cunning speech.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i> And is’t not so?</p>

<p><i>Fool.</i> Oh no! by my troth, our good sovereign hath unto my noble
master betrayed great lack of policy.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i> How so?</p>

<p><i>Fool.</i> Why, your wise man will tell you, the crown doth gall the
wearer; but, marry, I will show myself the fool indeed; for I do say
the half oft pinches more than the whole.</p>

<p><i>Pas.</i> Thou wouldst be witty, Fool!</p>

<p><i>Fool.</i> Marry, say not I would be, but that I am; for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> let me
tell you, the wit of your Fool is true wit: being solely his own, no
man coveting it; whereas, that of your wise man comes from books, and
from those who went before. But wherefore should I thus lose wind? My
wit, being folly, is not by your wise man understood; therefore, I’ll
to the purpose. My master is made half king, and sends me, his Mercury,
to tell your gentle ladyship his honour’s pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Edm.</i> Prithee, be brief, and speak thine errand quickly.</p>

<p><i>Fool.</i> An’t please you, sweetest mistress, this he wills: that,
in your best attire, you straight attend to honor him and th’ other
half of the crown.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
